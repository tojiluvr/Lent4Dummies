            <h2>Understanding Lent</h2>
            <p>
                Lent is a season observed by many Christians as a time of reflection, prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. It begins on Ash Wednesday and lasts for 40 days, excluding Sundays, leading up to Easter Sunday. This period symbolizes the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert before beginning his public ministry.

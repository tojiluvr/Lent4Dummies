            <h2>Where did Lent come freom?</h2>
            <p>
                Lent is believed to have evolved from early Christian practices of preparing for baptism and commemorating Jesus' time in the desert. Which would date it back to around the 2nd and 3rd centuries. It is known that the practice of fasting before baptism and other significant spiritual events were very common in early Christianity. Looking at the more obvious side, 40 days of fasting was the exact same amount of time that Jesus Christ spent in the desert, where he had to fast for 40 days. And whilst it may sound terrifying to fast for 40 days, it is important to remember that ultimately Lent is a time for Christians to reflect on their lives, repent for their sins, and prepare their hearts for the celebration of Jesus' resurrection on Easter.

                He tempted Jesus to turn stones into bread, to throw himself off the edge of a cliff, and to praise him in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world. Jesus had to stay strong and disciplined to deny all of the Devils temptations, which is why people might give something up, in order to test their own self-discipline too.

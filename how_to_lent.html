            <h2>What exactly do you do in Lent?</h2>
            <p>
                In Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in imitation of Christ's sacrifice during his journey into the desert for 40 days; this is known as one's Lenten sacrifice. In simple terms, you basically give up anything you feel like you have to (No, not something like exercise or eating healthy) You could start by doing something like giving up meat, sweets, social media, or watching TV or even listening to music.

            <h2>Why should I do Lent?</h2>
            <p>
                If you are a Christian, Lent can be a very big opportunity to strengthen your faith and your relationship with God. You could also see it as a time to address the issues in your life, and fast of them. It is impoortant to remember that Lent is not a 'test' or a 'requirement'. But it is strongly advised by other Christians that you partake in Lent as it can really get you closer to God. If you are new to Lent, you can start with small changes and gradually increase your efforts. If you are unsure about anything to do with Lent, eek guidance from your priest or spiritual advisor.

               To properly practice Lent, focus on the three pillars: prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, dedicating time to reflection, service, and deepening your relationship with God through these practices.
